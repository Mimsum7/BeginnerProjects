# BeginnerProjects

I have embarked on a 30 day coding challenge to strengthen my programming skills. I will be doing one mini project per day to learn something new/reinforce what I know and populate my github. The projects will increase in difficulty per week and this is the repo for beginner projects.

Mini project 1: HelloWorld API
I learnt to create an API using the python library Flask. This is my first time making an API from scratch and I have learnt a lot about working with Flask. I am now able to use decorators and functions as well as manipulate port numbers and roots. My challenge here was running into 404 errors when I changed the root and port numbers but I have learnt a lot of troubleshooting methods in the debugging process.

Mini project 2: Number Analyser
I learnt how to create a number analyser. This is a CLI to tell you what kind of number you are dealing with: even, odd, prime etc. This project taught me how to use try-except, strenghthened my conditional statement use, and ternary expressions. This was my first time hearing of try-except methods, I learnt that they are Python's way of saying “Hey, try this block of code — but if something goes wrong, don’t crash. Here’s what to do instead.” I did not run into any major problems with this project, just a minor indentation error which I realised matters a lot in Python for the code to run. I also picked up the fact that Python runs line by line
