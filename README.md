# BeginnerProjects

I embarked on a 5 day coding challenge to strengthen my programming skills. I did one mini project per day to learn something new/reinforce what I know and populate my github. These are beginner projects to let me get a feel for the concepts within them.

Mini project 1: HelloWorld API
I learnt to create an API using the python library Flask. This is my first time making an API from scratch and I have learnt a lot about working with Flask. I am now able to use decorators and functions as well as manipulate port numbers and roots. My challenge here was running into 404 errors when I changed the root and port numbers but I have learnt a lot of troubleshooting methods in the debugging process.

Mini project 2: Number Analyser
I learnt how to create a number analyser. This is a CLI to tell you what kind of number you are dealing with: even, odd, prime etc. This project taught me how to use try-except, strenghthened my conditional statement use, and ternary expressions. This was my first time hearing of try-except methods, I learnt that they are Python's way of saying “Hey, try this block of code — but if something goes wrong, don’t crash. Here’s what to do instead.” I did not run into any major problems with this project, just a minor indentation error which I realised matters a lot in Python for the code to run. I also picked up the fact that Python runs line by line

Mini project 3: Quote Generator API
This project is an API that fetches random quotes and displays them on an html page. I faced a challenge with my Flask connection and so the quotes are not displaying on my html page. I tried mulltiple troubleshooting methods and consulted AI for assistance, however, none of it is working. My flask is running well on both my cmd and Visual studio terminal so I am not sure what the problem is. I may revisit this project later on with fresh eyes to see if I can fix it but for now I need to proceed with day 4.

Mini project 4: Currency converter
I learnt how to use a real world API and strengthen my error handling skills with try-except function. The project was very straight forward with minimal errors to address. I am now able to use an external API and make GET requests as well as input validation. 

Mini Project 5: Currency Converter with GUI
I scaled up this project by making it able to convert multiple currencies at once and I added a GUI using tkinter. I learnt about Python GUI when I was in first year of my software engineering degree and this was a nice refresher on how to use tkinter.
